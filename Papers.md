Clearly, only requiring “meaningful”, “descriptive”, or “self-documenting” names is insufficient. First, a name not only needs to be meaningful but reflect the correct mean- ing. Second, the “correct” meaning and name of a concept is naturally highly debatable.

There is clear evidence that the semantic contents of words is processed even be- fore the syntactical structure of the sentence is taken into ac- count [3]

Eye movements, the perceptual span, and reading speed

The main findings were that fast readers (reading at about 330 wpm) had a larger perceptual span than slow readers (reading about 200 wpm) and the span was not affected by whether or not the text was fixed-width or proportional-width. 

the perceptual span for skilled readers of alphabetic writing systems consists of 3-4 letters to the left of fixation (or the beginning of the currently fixated word) and 14-15 letter spaces to the right of fixation (see Rayner, 1998, 2009 for reviews).

That the asymmetry of the span is a function of attention is evident from the finding that it is reversed for readers of Hebrew (Pollatsek, Bolozky, Well, & Rayner, 1981) who obtain more information from the left of fixation than to the right. It is also clear that the span is not simply the result of acuity limitations as Miellet, O'Donnell, and Sereno (2009) demonstrated that the span to the right of fixation remained 14-15 letter spaces when they used a parafoveal magnification technique in which letters on each fixation became increasingly larger further from fixation (to offset acuity limitations).

Second, the size of the perceptual span did not differ between a fixed-width and a proportional spacing font. This result validates prior research using the moving window paradigm that has used only fixed-width fonts. Additionally, the type of font did not influence reading rate, but there was an interesting tradeoff between fixation duration and number of fixations. Specifically, the Consolas (fixed-width) font yielded more forward fixations than the Georgia (proportional) font, but fixation durations were shorter for the Consolas font than the Georgia font leading to no overall difference in reading rate. A likely reason for these tradeoffs is that Consolas letters are wider than those in Georgia font. This may make the encoding of the foveal letters more efficient (due to their larger size) but would allow fewer letters to be located within the fovea at any given time thereby requiring more fixations for complete encoding. This notion is supported by the size of forward saccades which traversed fewer letters with the wider Consolas font. However, if forward saccade length is measured in visual angle instead of number of letter spaces, the difference between the two fonts is negligible (2.33 and 2.30 deg, respectively). Therefore, while the eyes were moving a similar absolute distance in both fonts, this indicates that more letters were processed with each fixation in the smaller proportional width Georgia font.

Finally, there was an interesting effect of spacing in which reduced letter spacing (intra-word spacing) actually led to faster reading rates (as well as shorter and fewer forward fixations) than the normal spacing condition. We suspect that this effect is due to the combination of intra-word and inter-word spacing (spacing between words) with much of the benefit being due to increased inter-word spacing. That is, it may be the case that reducing the spacing between letters within a word actually hinders word identification to some extent due to increased lateral masking of the word interior letters, but if so, this effect is outweighed by benefits to reading from the inclusion of additional space between words which decreases lateral masking of exterior word letters and provides for superior boundary demarcation. Such benefits from additional inter-word spacing have been reported in previous studies (Drieghe, Brysbasert, & Desmet, 2005; cf., Paterson & Jordan, 2010) and may be due to improved targeting of saccades to optimal locations.

 The results of the study indicate that both groups acquire letter information from a region of text extending from two letters to the left of the center of the fixation through to about six or seven letters to the right.

Shorter lines are more comfortable to read than longer lines. As line length increases, your eye has to travel farther from the end of one line to the beginning of the next, making it harder to track your progress vertically. Aim for an average line length of 45–90 characters, including spaces.
